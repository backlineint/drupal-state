## Contributing

### Prerequisites

Steps below assume that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed. We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage the NodeJS version on your local system.

In order to prepare your system for contribution you'll need to complete this checklist:

1. Run `nvm use` to switch to the expected version of npm. Run `nvm install` if you need to update your npm.
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
